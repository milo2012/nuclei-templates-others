This repository contains custom [Nuclei](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei) templates developed for version detection across various services and applications.

## 📁 templates/

The `templates/` folder includes a curated collection of Nuclei templates that I created to assist with fingerprinting and version identification. These templates are especially useful during reconnaissance and vulnerability assessments, helping to quickly detect software versions and potential misconfigurations.
